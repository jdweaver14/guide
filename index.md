2. Create an index.md (markdown) file in your repository and commit
- Once you have created your repository, create a new markdown file within it called “index.md”. Commit this file (default settings).
From your repository, go to Settings.

- Our site is published at https://digitalportfolio.github.io/guide - Yours will be published at <yourgithubusername>.github.io/<repositoryname> (the url can also be found in your settings > Pages)

## Editing Pages

Your GitHub page can be edited in Markdown, a lightweight markup language. We have compiled a cheat sheet of some basic Markdown syntax to get you started with editing your page and adding content. 


# Creating Content

If you are not sure how to start adding content to your digital portfolio, you can use your Resume as a starting point. For help with your resume, you can check out the Cornell Career Services [Resume Prep Page](https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved/career-services/resumes-and-interview-prep/resumes) or the Cornell Engineering Career Services ["Build A Better Resume"](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/departments/career%20services/Build%20A%20Better%20Resume-%20Technical-%20Fall%202017.ppt) Guide.

## Your Bio

You will likely want to include an “About Me” or “Bio” page. Here you can summarize who you are, what you are working on and what you are interested in.

You could include information on the following:
- Background
- Education
- Current Work
- Areas of Professional Interest
- Personal Interests / Hobbies 

Once you have your bio, pop it onto your GitHub repository. You can add links in markdown like this:
